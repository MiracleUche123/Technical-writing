Characters
The game will start with three skill tiers. New skills will be added with time.
Tier 1: Healer Skill; Healers give comfort keeps the community going and healthy
(1CPM).	
Tier 2: Warrior Skill; Warriors win wars and bring home the spoils of war (3CPM).
Tier3: Lord Skill; Lords reign supreme over all other citizens to control and keep balance (5CPM).

All Players start at level 1 and require a set amount of $SWG to level up. Each level provides a reward point that can be spent on improving your $CODE production. 
Each level requires more $SWG, making it increasingly more challenging to get reward points. Reward points can be used to increase your CPM, decrease fatigue, increase the number of citizens staked, allow you to use certain citizen skills, and so on.

Requirements
SwirgeTopia Citizens are your golden access to SwirgeTopia.

The Story


Citizens /How to become a Citizen
SwirgeTopia Citizens are ERC721 NFTs that can be minted for 0.3 BNB each for Gen0. Generation 0 (Gen 0) citizens have a maximum supply of 10,000. After all Gen0 have been minted, Gen 1 will be available to mint.
You can mint Gen 1 citizens for $CODE, which is the main in-game currency. All tokens from minting Gen 1 will be burned. When minting a citizen, there is a 5% chance that you will mint a Master Citizen, a more skillful citizen who can produce $CODE 3 times faster (3CPM).)
You can put your citizens to work by staking them in the SwirgeTopia contract. At first, you can only stake a maximum of 10 citizens in the contract. As your business expands, you can acquire more citizens. A regular citizen produces 1 $CODE per minute, while the Master Citizen produces 3$CODE per minute.
When you claim the produced $CODE, 10% of the claims get burned, and 10% go to the Bank. Each citizen gets fatigued as they work non-stop, producing $CODE. The higher the $CODE production (CPM), the faster the citizens are fatigued. Fatigued citizens produce less and less $CODE and eventually stop producing $CODE. For a citizen to recover, it needs to be unstaked and then rest for up to 12 hours, depending on the fatigued level. While recovering, the citizen cannot produce $CODE

Marketplace

Players will be able to produce $CODE and acquire more SKILLS with their CITIZENS. As citizens are NFTs, they can be traded on our custom internal NFT marketplace or  popular NFT marketplaces such as NFTrade and Radio CaCa.
Whenever a player claims a $CODE in SwirgeTopia, 10% goes to the bank as flat tax.
The marketplace will use $CODE as its default token and users will stipulate the price of their NFT however they see fit, so be on the lookout for the next bargain!






Use cases (PlaytoEarn, HowtoEarn)

PlaytoEarn
The game has a more relaxed pace, focusing on strategy. Players need to balance the number of citizens, skills, and SwirgeTopian levels to attain the highest level of efficiency.
You can put your citizens to work by staking them in the SwirgeTopia contract. At first, you can only stake a maximum of 10 citizens in the contract. As your business expands, you can acquire more citizens. If a player wishes to buy a skill, he has to have a SwirgeTopian Citizen ready to use that skill — this will prevent skill hoarding and give players more strategies to choose from. Moreover, this gives citizens an everlasting utility as they are required to play and limits the number of skills a player can stake.
 
A regular citizen produces 1 $CODE per minute, while the Master Citizen produces 3$CODE per minute. When you claim the produced $CODE, 10% of the claims get burned, and 10% go to the Bank.
Each citizen gets fatigued as they work non-stop, producing $CODE. The higher the $CODE production (CPM), the faster the citizens are fatigued. Fatigued citizens produce less and less $CODE and eventually stop producing $CODE.
The fatigue mechanic makes the game more challenging as the CPM (Citizen Production) gets higher, Players will need to develop intelligent ways to have the highest CPM possible without over-fatiguing their citizens!
 
For a citizen to recover, it needs to be unstaked and then rest for up to 12 hours, depending on the fatigued level. While recovering, the citizen cannot produce $CODE.
 
Buying $CODE and $SWG is very important to get an edge in the game and can be used as a catch-up mechanic for players who didn't start on day 1.

HowtoEarn
When you send your citizens on missions, they produce $CODE every minute (1CPM) that you can claim and use to purchase skills. All citizens produce $CODE forever, which means $CODE does not have a maximum supply. However, $CODE is constantly being burned when players claim $CODE in the game, mint skills, mint Gen 1 citizens, and unstake $CODE from the Bank. Also, citizens are NFTs. Hence, they can be traded on popular NFT marketplaces such as NFTrade and Radio CaCa.
Meanwhile, 25% of the Gen 0 minting revenue will be used to add liquidity on the $CODE-BNB pair on PancakeSwap, so this currency can be traded right away as the game start.



Value of $CODE in the game
You can earn $SWG in Swirge Finance, and you need to create a $CODE-BNB Liquidity pair on PancakeSwap and stake the LP tokens in Swirge Finance. The more the LP tokens you stake, the more the $SWG tokens you get.  $SWG is an ERC20 capped and deflationary token built to power the entire Swirge ecosystem. $SWG token will complement the $CODE token in SwirgeTopia





Rarity and Attributes
The Citizens’ attributes are generated randomly through the blockchain. Attached below is documentation of their rarity criteria.

Whenever a player purchases a citizen, its rarity is randomly created. The rarity reflects the probability of a Citizen to obtain more skills and features. Also, the rarity increases with more combination of uncommon skills and features. These acquisitions become the Citizen’s accessories. And it determines each Citizen’s base stats. Hence, the value of a Citizen increases with a higher rarity value.


Structure of the game
Players must send their Citizens NFT on mission by staking them in the swirgeTopia contract, and get reward of $SWG tokens
The player's reward will be calculated by the formula:
Citizens = Skills = $CODE = Swirge Finance = $SWG 


Reward Details
Players that possess “citizens” on SwirgeTopia can earn numerous $CODE per minute, as the citizens are constantly sent on missions. By earning more $CODE, players can acquire and trade their citizens’ NFTS in popular exchanges like PancakeSwap. In the course of the game, players can always acquire more skills which increases the rate of $CODE their citizens can produce in the game. Hence, as players produce more $CODE and collect more skills in the game, the more they tend to dominate the SwirgeTopian realm. This increases the number of collectibles for each player, which can be traded as NFTs on popular exchanges.

This way, we have partially solved the problem of inflation while still ensuring earnings for players. Thanks to the cooperation of the Swirge team

Game Modes
PvE (Player versus Environment) - first game mode
In this mode, the gamer competes with an AI-controlled (artificial intelligence) opponent rather than against other real-time players while progressing through the game’s storyline. This mode distinguishes PvE multiplayer role-playing games from player-versus-player (PvP) real-time strategy games. And it can be played either alone, with human companions, or with AI companions. 

PVP (Player versus Player) - second game mode
In this mode, the gamer competes with other real-time players of the online game. Every player tries to put their opponent(s) in a disadvantaged position to prevent them from doing the same to you. Player-versus-player mode can be synchronous, which involves two gamers playing against each other in real-time, or asynchronous when a gamer plays another player that is assisted by the AI system.

Smart Contracts
You can stake hard-earned $CODE in the Bank contract to get $CODE even faster. Whenever a player claims $CODE in SwirgeTopia, 10% goes to the Bank as a flat tax. You can stake your $CODE in the Bank to get a cut of those taxes. Suppose you want to withdraw your $CODE (unstake) from the Bank. You have two options; slowly withdraw your $CODE, making sure you minimize your losses, or do it in a hurry, losing most of the benefits.
It takes two days to withdraw $CODE from the Bank using the slow method, and 10% will be burned. If you want to withdraw in a hurry, 25% stays in the Bank as a flat tax, and 25% will be burned.
